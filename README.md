# budgety
A simple JavaScript budget app showing income and expenses. As more entries are added the UI will be updated accordingly to show each entry, the resulting totals as well as percentages. 

The percentage in the top display with **Expenses** is the percentage of your total income used by your expenses entered thus far --> *Total Expenses / Total Income*. 

The percentage next to each expense entry is the percentage that particular entry makes up of total expenses --> *Entry / Total Expenses*.

## Entering Income and Expenses
### Income
By default, the input is set to Income. Ensure the **+** is shown in the selection box. Simply type a description inside the *"Add Description"* box, enter the amount in the *"Value"* box and either press **Enter** or click the *Checkmark button*.

### Expenses
To enter an expense first click the selection box and select the minus **-** sign. By default, this will be **+** so you must change it to enter an expense. Enter a description in the *"Add Description"* box, enter amount in the *"Value"* box and either press **Enter** or click the *Checkmark button*.
